# Support icons

- We should have a special item for header icons (to the left of the name).
- The root could have a default icon, like  , and that should be customizable with `opts.root_marker` and
- The icon should have the same color as the node’s name (or be grey? is it great grey as well?).
- By default, creating a node comes with no icon. However, pressing `I` on a node allows the user to set / edit the
  node’s icon.
