# Insert Mind* highlight

We currently allow users to change the names of the highlight, but we should instead define our own highlights (and
default the configuration to them — i.e. `opts.ui.highlight.*`)

That way, coloschemes could provide their own overrides, like what they do with Hop.

Don’t forget to allow changing the `Normal` highlight.
