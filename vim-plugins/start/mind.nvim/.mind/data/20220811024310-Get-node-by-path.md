# Get node by path

We want to get nodes by path. That is super useful for things like journaling: instead of opening the tree and looking
for the current year, month and adding a node for the current day, we could instead automate that process by getting the
right node immediately. For instance, `date "+Journal/%Y/%b"` would give us the right path to look for.
`Journal/2022/Aug/11` would be a node that would need to be created if it doesnâ€™t exist (along with its parent(s)), and
we would open its data file (that would also be created, if needed).

And that would be super powerful.
