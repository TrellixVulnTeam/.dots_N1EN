# Remove this tree from git

We need to move all those items to my machine as a tree, because people downloading the plugin also downloads this tree,
which is not ideal. Especially, we have a couple of items that Windows users cannot clone, which is a pity.

I’m not quite sure I want to remove it actually. It’s a pretty good “bootstrapped” idea and people can have a look at it
if they are curious.
