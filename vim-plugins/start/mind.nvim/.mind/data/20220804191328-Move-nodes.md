# Move nodes

Moving a node should be a two step process:

1. The user puts their cursor on a node and press a keybind to move the node.
2. The user then have to chose another node and press another keybinding to move _before_ or _after_ the node. And
   that’s all.

So basically, it’s copy and paste.

The last remaining thing is to be able to move in another tree and inside.
