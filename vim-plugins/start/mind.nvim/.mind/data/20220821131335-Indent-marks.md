# Indent marks

Currently, I’m relying on a plugin to draw indent marks, which is not ideal because not everyone will have the indent
marks. Instead, it should be super simple to create them manually.

For anything a line that is not a parent, we want to insert │ every cycle of indentation.
For when it’s a parent, want └.

Okay so well it’s a bit more complicated than that. Basically, we want to insert the L in front of a node if it’s the
last one, but we need to change the « indent » thing of the children. So we basically need two information to render a
node:

- The currently active header.
- Whether it’s the last one.

Let’s take an example:

  mind.nvim local
└  陼Tasks                                               -- last node, so it must be L
  │   Backlog                                           -- its children should use its indent + ' '
  │   On-going
  │ └ Indent marks                                       -- last node

    └ lel                                                 -- last node too
